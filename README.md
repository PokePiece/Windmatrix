# 🌪️ Windmatrix

**The Windmatrix** is a neuronic intelligence interface platform designed to interact with **the Void** — a crystallized repository of advanced cloud intelligence. This system enables high-bandwidth communication between human and machine through keyboard-driven input and responsive, intelligent automation.

## 🧠 Overview

Built on top of the Void cloud backend, the Windmatrix acts as the **frontline interface** for intelligent delegation, automation, and information analysis. Through this unified interface, users can communicate with advanced AI models, delegate tasks, and manage information workflows with extreme efficiency.

The Windmatrix is designed as a preliminary scaffold for wireless neural BCIs — but even without physical interfaces, it serves as a powerful and practical platform for intelligent interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Connects to the Void** for intelligent routing, response generation, and automation
- 🧠 **Cloud intelligence access** with live, reactive tooling
- 👁️ **Clean UI** for interacting with LLMs and backend processes
- 💾 **Supabase** integration for user auth and data storage
- ⚡ **Next.js + TypeScript** for performance and maintainability
- 🔒 User sign-in with secure API access
- 🛠️ Automated tools for intelligent operations

## 🛸 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (via the Void)
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Local or cloud-hosted
